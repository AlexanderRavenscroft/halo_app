## **Overview**
This is a Flutter-based mobile app created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills in mobile development. The app collects user location using geolocator package and fetches current weather from API based on current location. Through this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of REST APIs, Geolocator package, and minimalistic UI design UI design.

## **Skills Showcase**
- **Flutter & Dart**: Built a responsive and performant mobile app using Flutter widgets and Dart programming.
- **State Management**: Implemented Provider for efficient state management.
- **API Integration**: Integrated RESTful APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.
- **UI/UX Design**: Designed minimal and visually appealing user interface using Flutter's Material Design components and Lottie Animations.
- **Version Control**: Used Git and GitHub for version control and disabled `*.env` in `.gitignore`
- **Debugging & Testing**: Tested the app on both Android and iOS devices. Used Device Manager to test different screen sizes and Dart DevTools for performance analysis.

## **Challenges & Learnings**
Throughout this project, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a developer. Here are some key takeaways:  

### **Technical Challenges**  

- **Handling Location Errors** (Geolocator Package) 
  - **Solution:** Implemented error handling based on API response codes, ensuring a smooth user experience even when location permissions are denied.  
  
- **Handling Slow Network Responses & API Failures** 
  - **Solution:** Added a loading indicator and graceful error messages for slow or failed API requests to enhance user experience.
  
- **Dynamically Displaying Weather Animations** 
  - **Solution:** Designed a flexible **Weather Model** using Dart classes to map API responses to UI animations. 
  
### **Key Learnings & Improvements**  
- **Strengthened my understanding** of REST APIs and JSON data handling in Flutter.  
- **Explored different ways** to handle permissions in Flutter and provide user-friendly error message 
- **Learned how to** optimize network requests to reduce unnecessary API calls and improve app responsiveness.

## **GitHub Disclaimer**
I’m still learning Git and improving my workflow. As a result:
- Some repositories might be messy due to experimentation.
- The commit dates may appear non-chronological as I often work on multiple projects simultaneously.
- I work on multiple devices, which sometimes leads to inconsistencies in commit authorship.
- I recently changed my GitHub username, so older commits may still show my previous name (ShenAbuser).

Thanks for understanding as I continue to grow as a developer!
